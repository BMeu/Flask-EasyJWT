    """
        The base class for representing JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

        To use a JWT, you have to create a subclass inheriting from :class:`FlaskEasyJWT`. All public instance variables
        of this class (that is, all instance variables not starting with an underscore) will make up the claim set of
        your token (there will be a few meta claims in the token as well that :class:`FlaskEasyJWT` needs to verify the
        token). For details, see the documentation of `EasyJWT <https://easyjwt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

        :class:`FlaskEasyJWT` simplifies the usage of `EasyJWT` in Flask applications by allowing to specify a few
        common settings in the application's configuration:

        * The key used for encoding and decoding a token can be specified in the configuration key `EASYJWT_KEY`.
        * The validity of a token can be specified in the configuration key `EASYJWT_TOKEN_VALIDITY`. The expiration
          date will be set at the time of creation of a token to the current time plus the specified duration (in
          seconds).
